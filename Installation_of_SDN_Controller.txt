Requires ncclient program supplied with the DVD as well as present in the code repository at https://shrikanthmd1986@bitbucket.org/shrikanthmd1986/ncclient.git

just goto the folder that contains setup.py, in the DVD goto -> Controller-Code/ncclient
execute sudo python setup.py install

BINGO!!! ncclient is installed.


It is expected that all the dependencies are installed for RYU Controller following the link: 
To install RYU SDN controller,
Goto the path Controller-Code/RYU/ryu-4.10 and execute 

sudo python setup.py install

To run the RYU Controller monitoring application, run the below command


ryu-manager /media/shrikanth/OPENNSL/Final-Submission/Controller-Code/RYU/ryu-4.10/ryu/app/monitoring_conf/monitoring_application.py


The above command will run the application, installs a monitoring agent with ID 5 and listens to the switch for notifications.
It handles MON_SWITCH notifications at the moment and ignores all other notifications.

NOTE: /media/shrikanth/OPENNSL/Final-Submission/ should be replaced bz which ever path you copy the Controller-Code/ folder to.

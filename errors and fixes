Makefile.am in src folder and in main folder - differences. - check shrikanths documents , he has written the difference and in which file the changes have to be made while compliing the code. 

..................................

switch id and pwd - 

id - root pwd - onl
id - mamtha pwd - pass

.......................................................

MOST IMPORTANT - Switch is like debian or linux. so use the commands as u do in linux to work on the switch. 

........................................................

setting ip on a PC. 
restart the network - fix errors issues by bringing the network up and down. 

to restart a network on PC after setting the the new ip address.  

$ sudo /etc/init.de/networking restart
$ ifconfig - check if the new ip set is der or not.  if not bring down the network and bring it up again. and it would be done. below are the steps. 
$ sudo ifdown etho
$ sudo ifup etho

..........................................
To start the netconf server - *** dont forget it. 

$ ofc -sever -v 3 -f // f represents to run it in foreground.


If another instance of netconf server running then it wont execute. Hence, kill it and start the netconf server again. 

1. $ ps -aux | grep ofc // displays all the instances of ofc processes. 
2. $ kill -9 2112 //2112 is the process id or you can also delete the file "ofc.soc". Its in the path user/local..something


To check instances of monitor-automata- 

$ ps -eaf | grep monitor
........................................................
on switch - 

$ ip addr show 
$ ip -s link show interface-name
...............................................

on switch - if no disk space error - remove all the logs related to you. 

$ rm -rf monitor-application.*
......................................................

copying from one place to another 

from switch to switch -> 
$ cp -R src destn (destination can just be "." - without quotes, it means current directoty.)

from switch to local machine -> 
$ scp src_path_from_pc username@host:/home/..  (username - root/mamtha, /home/.. is the destn path, host is the ip addres)

...........................................

find ip of a switch. Connect to a switch by three ways. 

1. first connect to it via the console port. 
2. login using $ /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
3. it open a black screen. press enter. it asked for username and passwork. enter it. You can connected. :)
   if this doesnt work and if you want to check if you are connected to the switch or not. then type - "dmesg -w | grep tty"  -> it gives all the instances. so now yoy now that you are connected. without quotes.

4. then type ifconfig to get the ip. ma1 is its representation. check in that para. That is the ip. THis works only if you are the root else ifconfig  doesnt work. If you are connect to the switch as some other user then you have to type "/sbin/ifconfig". THis gives the ip. without quotes
5. now using this IP, you can connect through SSH. i.e - $ ssh root@10.162.96.101 . root-username, 10.162.96.101 - ip of the switch. press enter
6. now enter the password for it. "onl" or whatever your password is. Now you are connected. :)

7. can be done through putty too. give the path. /dev/ttyUSB0. **select option serial among the four others just below it. enter the port speed - 115200.
   You are now connected. :)

....................................

reboot the switch - instead of turning it off again. 

$ sudo reboot 

...............................

to open the log file - always better to do it and so that it is accessible to see the whole. else only the current updates will be shown, you cant go up to check the previous messages. really annoying. Hence use the command - 

$ tail -f /var/log/monitor-application.log

.............................................

to check the traffic on the switch - 

$ iftop-n

........................................................

capture packets - 

1. first install tcpdump -> $ sudo apt-get install tcpdump

2. different options to capture the packets- 

Capture Packets from source IP -> $ tcpdump -i eth0 src 192.168.0.2
Capture Packets from destination IP -> $ tcpdump -i eth0 dst 50.116.66.139
Capture Packet from Specific Port -> $ tcpdump -i eth0 port 22
Capture only TCP Packets. -> $ tcpdump -i eth0 tcp
Capture IP address Packets -> $ tcpdump -n -i eth0
Read Captured Packets File ->  $ tcpdump -r 0001.pcap
Capture and Save Packets in a File -> $ tcpdump -w 0001.pcap -i eth0
tcpdump -w 0001.pcap -i eth0 -> $ tcpdump -XX -i eth0
Display Available Interfaces -> $ tcpdump -D
Print Captured Packets in ASCII -> $ tcpdump -A -i eth0 // option -A displays the package in ASCII format.
Capture Only N Number of Packets -> $ tcpdump -c 5 -i eth0 // using -c option, you can capture specified number of packets. The below example will only 
															capture 6 packets.
Capture Packets from Specific Interface -> $ tcpdump -i eth0

editing a file in nano editor - 

ctrl+ o+ enter //dont forget enter. - save
ctrl + x+ enter //exit terminal

................................................................

editing a file in vi editor - 

:wq + enter - save and quit
:x - save and quit
:w! - quit without saving

netopeer client 

$ netopeer-cli
 netconf> connect --login root 10.162.96.101 // if of the switch.

 netconf> user-rpc

 // issues faced here. I copy pasted the msgs from shrikanths thesis. BUt the "-" was in a different format so it wasnt ruuning. so check this before running. 
 // ALso the editor sucked big time so i changed the editor to nano and used it. 
 netconf> editor nano  // this sets the editor of netopeer to nano. 

 if you want to know all the options then use help. it lists down all the options and you can choose. 
 netconf> help

Git hub - 

Go to the respective folder you want to push

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/mamthajm/ryu-controller.git
git push origin master

if git already linked then it gives an error if you try to push it to another repo. 
so set the url to ur current repo 
git remote set-url origin  https://github.com/mamthajm/RYU.git

Fixing open nsl error

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16710047/usr-bin-ld-cannot-find-lnameofthelibrary

To figure out what the linker is looking for, run it in verbose mode.

For example, I encountered this issue while trying to compile MySQL with ZLIB support. I was receiving an error like this during compilation:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lzlib
I did some Googl'ing and kept coming across different issues of the same kind where people would say to make sure the .so file actually exists and if it doesn't, then create a symlink to the versioned file, for example, zlib.so.1.2.8. But, when I checked, zlib.so DID exist. So, I thought, surely that couldn't be the problem.

I came across another post on the Internets that suggested to run make with LD_DEBUG=all:

LD_DEBUG=all make
Although I got a TON of debugging output, it wasn't actually helpful. It added more confusion than anything else. So, I was about to give up.

Then, I had an epiphany. I thought to actually check the help text for the ld command:

ld --help
From that, I figured out how to run ld in verbose mode (imagine that):

ld -lzlib --verbose
This is the output I got:

==================================================
attempt to open /usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib64/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib64/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /usr/local/lib64/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /usr/local/lib64/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /lib64/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /lib64/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /usr/lib64/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /usr/lib64/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /usr/local/lib/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /usr/local/lib/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /lib/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /lib/libzlib.a failed
attempt to open /usr/lib/libzlib.so failed
attempt to open /usr/lib/libzlib.a failed
/usr/bin/ld.bfd.real: cannot find -lzlib
Ding, ding, ding...

So, to finally fix it so I could compile MySQL with my own version of ZLIB (rather than the bundled version):

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libz.so.1.2.8 /usr/lib/libzlib.so
Voila!

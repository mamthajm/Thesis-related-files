I took the following step.

1.  run mininet
        $ sudo mn --topo single,2 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote -x

2. set OpenFlow version to s1
      s1> ovs-vsctl set Bridge s1 protocols=OpenFlow13

3. run application
    c0> ryu-manager ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py ryu/app/ofctl_rest.py

4. send ping
     mininet> h1 ping h2

5. get flow stats
        c0> curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/stats/flow/1
        (I got "OUTPUT:CONTROLLER", "OUTPUT:1", "OUTPUT:2")

6. clear flows
        c0> curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/stats/flowentry/clear/1

7. send ping again
     mininet> h1 ping h2
            (the ping is not reachable at this time)

8. get flow stats
        c0> curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/stats/flow/1
        (I got no flows)
